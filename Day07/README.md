# Day 7: Building a Secure VPC with Public and Private Subnets in AWS 🚀

## Project Overview 🌐

Today, we embark on the journey of creating a robust Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS for a secure production environment. Our goal is to set up a VPC with both public and private subnets, incorporating load balancers, auto scaling groups, and bastion hosts for enhanced scalability and security.

## Tasks for the Day 📋

1. **VPC Creation 🏗️**
   - Set up a new VPC in the AWS Management Console.
   - Define appropriate CIDR blocks for public and private subnets.

2. **Public Subnet Configuration 🌐**
   - Create a public subnet within the VPC.
   - Configure the necessary route tables for the public subnet.
   - Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic among instances.

3. **Private Subnet Configuration 🔒**
   - Establish a private subnet within the VPC.
   - Configure route tables to restrict external access for enhanced security.
   - Implement an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for dynamic instance scaling.

4. **Bastion Host Setup 🚪**
   - Deploy a bastion host in the public subnet for secure remote access to private instances.
   - Securely configure SSH access to the bastion host.

5. **Security Measures 🔐**
   - Implement Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) for additional network-level security.
   - Set up Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.

6. **Testing and Validation ✅**
   - Deploy sample instances in both public and private subnets.
   - Verify load balancer functionality, auto scaling behavior, and bastion host access.

## Helpful Tips 💡

- **CIDR Blocks**: Carefully choose CIDR blocks to avoid conflicts with existing networks.
- **Elastic IP**: Allocate Elastic IP addresses for instances that require a fixed public IP.
- **Security Groups**: Define rules to control inbound and outbound traffic for instances.
- **NACLs**: Use NACLs to add an extra layer of security at the subnet level.
