# Day 15: AWS CodePipeline Deep Dive üöÄ

## Overview

Welcome to Day 15 of the 30 Days of AWS series! Today, we're diving into the exciting world of AWS CodePipeline, a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipelines.

## What is a Pipeline?

In software development, a pipeline is a set of automated processes that allow code to be built, tested, and deployed reliably and efficiently. AWS CodePipeline is designed to streamline and automate these processes, providing a seamless path from source code to production.

## AWS CodePipeline Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **Source:** Connects to your source code repository (e.g., GitHub, AWS CodeCommit).
- **Build:** Builds the application code using build tools like AWS CodeBuild.
- **Test:** Runs automated tests to ensure code quality.
- **Deploy:** Deploys the application to various environments using deployment providers.
- **Invoke:** Executes additional actions or Lambda functions at any stage of the pipeline.

## Hands-On Lab

### Setting up a Simple CodePipeline üèóÔ∏è

Let's create a basic pipeline that fetches code from GitHub, builds it using AWS CodeBuild, and deploys it to an Amazon S3 bucket.

#### Step 1: Create a CodePipeline

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to CodePipeline.
2. Click "Create pipeline."
3. Provide a name for your pipeline and click "Next."

#### Step 2: Configure Source

1. Choose your source provider (e.g., GitHub).
2. Connect to your repository and select the branch.
3. Click "Next."

#### Step 3: Configure Build

1. Choose CodeBuild as the build provider.
2. Create a new CodeBuild project or use an existing one.
3. Click "Next."

#### Step 4: Configure Deploy

1. Choose a deployment provider (e.g., Amazon S3).
2. Configure deployment settings.
3. Click "Next."

#### Step 5: Review and Create

1. Review your pipeline configuration.
2. Click "Create pipeline."

### Observing the Pipeline in Action

1. Once created, observe the pipeline's stages and actions.
2. Monitor the progress and check logs for each stage.

Congratulations! You've successfully created and observed a basic AWS CodePipeline in action. üéâ

## Conclusion

AWS CodePipeline simplifies and accelerates the continuous delivery process, allowing developers to focus on writing code while automating the rest. Explore its various features and integrations to tailor it to your specific development needs.

Stay tuned for more AWS adventures tomorrow! üöÄ
