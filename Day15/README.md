# Day 15: AWS CodePipeline with CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy 🚀

## Overview
Welcome to Day 15 of the 30 Days of AWS series! Today, we'll dive into the AWS CodePipeline service and explore how to seamlessly integrate CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to create a robust continuous delivery pipeline.

## What is AWS CodePipeline? 🤔
AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that automates the build, test, and deployment phases of your release process. It allows you to create, manage, and visualize end-to-end workflows for your applications.

## Hands-On Guide 👩‍💻👨‍💻

### Step 1: Set Up CodeCommit Repository
1. Create a new CodeCommit repository using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

### Step 2: Create CodeBuild Project
1. Navigate to CodeBuild in the AWS Management Console.
2. Create a new build project, specifying your CodeCommit repository as the source.
3. Configure build settings, environment variables, and permissions.

### Step 3: Set Up CodeDeploy Application
1. Navigate to CodeDeploy in the AWS Management Console.
2. Create a new application and deployment group.
3. Define deployment settings and choose the instances to deploy to.

### Step 4: Create CodePipeline
1. Open the CodePipeline console.
2. Click on "Create pipeline."
3. Enter a pipeline name and choose your CodeCommit repository as the source.
4. Add a CodeBuild stage and select the CodeBuild project you created.
5. Add a CodeDeploy stage and configure the deployment settings.

### Step 5: Connect Stages in CodePipeline
1. In the CodePipeline console, connect the stages by defining transitions.
2. Add any necessary actions, such as approval steps or additional testing stages.

### Step 6: Start the Pipeline
1. Save and run your pipeline.
2. Monitor the pipeline execution in the CodePipeline console.

Congratulations! You've successfully created an end-to-end AWS CodePipeline that integrates CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy. 🎉

## Tips and Tricks 💡
- Use CloudWatch Logs and CodePipeline notifications to stay informed about pipeline executions.
- Experiment with different deployment strategies in CodeDeploy for flexible and safe deployments.

## Next Steps 🚀
Explore advanced features of CodePipeline such as manual approvals, parallel execution, and custom actions. Stay tuned for more AWS goodness in the next days of our series! ✨

Happy coding! 🚀✨
