# 30 Days of AWS Series - Day 4: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) 🚀

## Introduction

Welcome to Day 4 of the 30 Days of AWS Series! In today's lesson, we'll delve into the fundamental concept of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Understanding VPC is crucial for building a secure and isolated network environment for your AWS resources.

## What is a VPC?

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. It provides a secure and scalable environment for your applications while offering complete control over your network settings.

## Key Components of VPC

### Subnets 🌐

Subnets are segments of IP address ranges in your VPC. You can create multiple subnets in a VPC to organize and isolate your resources. Subnets can be public or private, depending on their accessibility from the internet.

### Route Tables 🗺️

A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. You can associate a route table with a subnet, controlling the traffic between subnets.

### Internet Gateway 🌐🚪

An Internet Gateway enables communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It allows resources in your public subnets to connect to the internet and vice versa.

### Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) 🔒

Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for your instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. Network ACLs operate at the subnet level, providing an additional layer of security.

### VPC Peering 🤝

VPC Peering allows you to connect one VPC with another, enabling communication between them using private IP addresses as if they are in the same network.

## Hands-On Exercise 🛠️

Today's hands-on exercise will guide you through creating a basic VPC with public and private subnets, configuring route tables, and launching instances. Check the [day-4-exercise.md](./day-4-exercise.md) file for detailed instructions.

## Resources 📚
